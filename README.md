# Text Generator with LSTM Model

This project demonstrates how to generate text using a pre-trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The model is trained on Shakespeare's text and can generate new text based on various "temperature" values, which control the randomness and creativity of the generated text.

---

## Features

- **Pre-trained LSTM model**: Generates text based on input sequences from Shakespeare's works.
- **Temperature control**: Adjusts the randomness of predictions to create more coherent or more creative text.
- **Custom text length**: Generates text of a user-defined length.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy

Install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
